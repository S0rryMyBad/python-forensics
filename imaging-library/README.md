Extracting valueable information from the resources available is a vital part of digital forensics. Getting access to all the information available is essential for an investigation process as it helps in retrieving appropriate evidence. Resources that contain data can be either simple data structures such as databases or complex data structures such as a **JPEG** image. Simple data structures can be easilly accessed using simple desktop tools, while extracting information from complex data structures require sophisticated programming tools.
